## Key Features
- **Keystroke Logging**: Captures user inputs from the keyboard in real time.
- **Clipboard Monitoring**: Tracks and logs clipboard data for further analysis.
- **Audio Recording**: Captures audio through system microphones.
- **Screenshot Capturing**: Takes periodic screenshots of the user's system.
- **Cloud Integration**: Utilizes Firebase Firestore for secure storage of logs and seamless real-time data management.

## Technologies Used
- **Python Libraries**:
  - `Pynput`: For keylogging functionalities.
  - `Pyperclip`: For clipboard monitoring.
  - `PyAudio`: For audio capture.
  - `PyScreenshot`: For capturing system screenshots.
- **Cloud Storage**: Firebase Firestore for secure and real-time data management.

## Purpose
This project serves as an educational tool, providing insights into the operations of spyware to promote cybersecurity awareness. **NetTrace** demonstrates how seemingly innocuous tools can compromise user privacy and security, stressing the need for vigilance against phishing and malware attacks.

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing user-specific log file naming for better data organization.
- Expanding cross-platform compatibility to support both Windows and Linux environments.
